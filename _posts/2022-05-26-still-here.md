I'm still here, luckily; both with and without a pun. Shortly after the last update, not more than a few days, I was not feeling well. Things deteriorated quite quickly and I tested positive for COVID19. Now, more than nine weeks later, I'm still recovering.

Even while being very careful from early February 2020 up until now. I've been very careful indeed. The knowledge that I've never reacted well to illnesses is a good motivator. As soon as the first vaccinations became available, I realized how dangerous the world could become. I predicted risky behavior under the vaccinated. Having had multiple adverse reactions to vaccinations before I could not take the risk to get vaccinated myself. And I was right and wrong. The risky behavior came true, both by the vaccinated and by people just having enough of all the COVID measures.

I probably got infected with the Omicron strand at the supermarket. About a short week before I fell ill, a woman was coughing in the faces of people and over the groceries. 

I'm still exhausted and still in pain.. The upcoming week I've got an appointment at the hospital to have a hypopharyngeal echography taken. I'm very lucky. Both heatwise, but also having a great team supporting me.

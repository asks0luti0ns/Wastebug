Iâ€™ve been struggling for about a week, for what to do with the documentation for the Wastebug project. Should I just stick to a README.md and INSTALL.md? Go for a Wiki on GitHub? Setup a dedicated website? Or add a section to the [ASK-Solutions website](https://www.ask-solutions.org/)? I've decided upon GitHub Pages.

The decision boils down to:
- GitHub is iffy about their wikis and search engines.
- I generally dislike wiki's.
- Me wanting more experience with Jekyll.
- I don't regard Wastebug a project or product of [ASK-Solutions](https://www.ask-solutions.org/) as we've always been more of a user of the project.
